# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the **edinet** project - a tool for retrieving Listed Company Disclosures from EDINET (Electronic Disclosure for Investors' NETwork), which is Japan's electronic disclosure system for corporate information.

## Current State

This repository is in its initial state with only basic project files:
- README.md with project description
- LICENSE file
- No build configuration files (package.json, Cargo.toml, etc.) detected yet

## Development Notes

The project appears to be in early development phase. When implementing features:
- This will likely involve interacting with EDINET's API for retrieving corporate disclosure documents
- Consider the target programming language and framework once development begins
- Build and test commands will need to be established as the project grows

## Product Requirement Document

Refer to the product requirement document located at .ai-rules/edinet_requirements_spec.md
